# Datasheets

In this chapter are the datasheets for the various devices used for the computer.

[74HC00 Quadruple 2-Input NAND Gate](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc00.pdf).

[SST39SF010A 1-Mbit Multi-Purpose Flash](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MPD/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/SST39SF010A-SST39SF020A-SST39SF040-Data-Sheet-DS20005022.pdf).
The correct pinout is the **PDIP** version on page 3.
This datasheet contains information for three variations of the flash chip;
we are using the smallest size, so pin 1 and pin 30 are both NC.

[AS6C62256 32K x 8 bit SRAM](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/12/AS6C62256_23_March_2016_rev1_2-1288423.pdf)

[W65C22](https://eater.net/datasheets/w65c22.pdf)
The pinout is all the way down on page 28.

[HD44780U (LCD Display Driver)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/5/f/7/b/HD44780.pdf)
The table of commands is on pages 23-25.
Table 11 on page 40 also has an interesting sequence of example commands that may be useful.

[W65C51N ACIA](https://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/documentation/w65c51n.pdf)
The pinout is on page 6.

[DS1813 Reset Supervisor](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ds1813.pdf)
The pinout is on page 1 and the application example is on page 2.
